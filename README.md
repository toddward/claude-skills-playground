   ```bash
   # From the repository root
   cd family-menu
   zip -r ../family-menu.zip .
   cd ..
   ```

   Or for all skills:

   - Navigate to the Skills section
   - Click "Add Skill" or "Upload Skill"
   - Select the `.zip` file you created
   - Claude will automatically extract and load the skill

## Skill Structure

Each skill directory follows this structure:

```
skill-name/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ SKILL.md              # Main instructions for Claude
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ scripts/              # Python/bash scripts (if needed)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ assets/               # Fonts, images, templates (if needed)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ references/           # Documentation, examples (if needed)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ LICENSE.txt           # License information (if applicable)
```

The `SKILL.md` file contains:
- **Frontmatter**: Name, description, and metadata
- **Instructions**: Detailed workflow and guidelines for Claude
- **Resources**: Information about included scripts and assets

## Usage

Once installed, skills are automatically available to Claude. Claude will recognize when to use each skill based on:

- The skill's description in the frontmatter
- Context clues in your conversation
- Explicit requests (e.g., "Use the brainstorming skill to help me design this feature")

## Development

### Creating New Skills

1. Create a new directory with your skill name
2. Add a `SKILL.md` file with frontmatter and instructions
3. Include any necessary scripts in a `scripts/` directory
4. Add assets (fonts, templates, etc.) to an `assets/` directory
5. Test the skill with Claude
6. Zip the directory for distribution

### Modifying Existing Skills

1. Edit the appropriate `SKILL.md` or script files
2. Re-zip the skill directory
3. Re-upload to Claude Code (may need to remove old version first)
